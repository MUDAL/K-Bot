# K-Bot  
The K-Bot is a floor cleaning robot with manual and automatic control.  
The aim of this project is to reduce the cost of a floor cleaning robot without altering its quality.     
The initial stage of the project involves developing and testing the manual aspects of the system.   
Currently, research is being done on the positioning and navigation of the robot in an indoor environment.
